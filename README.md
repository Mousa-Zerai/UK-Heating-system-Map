# Interactive Map of Electric Heating Systems

This repository contains an interactive map of properties with various electric heating systems, including **Community Scheme** types, based on the provided dataset.
The map has been generated using Python and the **Folium** library, with marker clustering and category-based color coding for easy visualization.

## Features

- **Marker Clustering**: Properties with electric heating systems are clustered to improve map navigation and performance.
- **Color-Coded Markers**: Each type of electric heating system is represented by a specific color, making it easy to identify different categories on the map.
- **Interactive Map**: The map can be zoomed and panned, and clicking on a marker reveals more information about the property and its heating system.

## How to View the Map
